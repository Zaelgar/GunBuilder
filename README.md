# GunBuilder
Gun Builder is my attempt at making a module based weapon building feature for a game. Originally built with cooperative PvE gameplay in mind, the overall design aims to  emphasize creativity and experimentation. Weapons are built using four swappable modules that can be infused with elements to change their behaviour.
